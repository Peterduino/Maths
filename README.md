# Maths

Here is a pretty basic website, that I created for my classmates (actually they still don't have access to it) to have a single place with maths lessons, and exercices that I created in python to learn those themas.

I put it here for you to have those exercices, even if it's in french... I think the features of the website are pretty cool, like the way I found to integrate the python shell into the page.
I assume the look is pretty Github homepage -ich, but I'm not a web designer, and I recreated everythink...
